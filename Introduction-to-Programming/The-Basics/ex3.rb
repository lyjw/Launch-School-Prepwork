# Exercise 3
# Write a program that uses a hash to store a list of movie titles with the year they came out. Then use the puts command to make your program print out the year of each movie to the screen. 

movies = {"Star Wars: The Phantom Menace" => 1999, "X-Men: First Class" => 2011, "The Princess Bride" => 1987, "Interstellar" => 2014}

puts movies["Star Wars: The Phantom Menace"]
puts movies["X-Men: First Class"]
puts movies["The Princess Bride"]
puts movies["Interstellar"]
